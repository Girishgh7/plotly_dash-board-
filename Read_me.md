# Housing Data Dashboard

This repository contains a Dash application for visualizing housing data. The app allows users to explore various features of the dataset through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface to explore housing data.
- **Data Table**: Displays the dataset in a tabular format with pagination.
- **Feature Selection**: Dropdown menu to select different features for visualization.
- **Histogram**: Dynamic histogram that updates based on the selected feature.

## Installation

To run the code, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-data-dashboard.git
cd housing-data-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the `housing.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.
2. **Run the App**: Execute the script to start the Dash application.
3. **Explore the Data**: Use the dropdown menu to select features and view the corresponding histograms.

### Example Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table, dcc, callback, Output, Input

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("housing.csv")

# Initialize the Dash app
app = Dash()

# Layout for the app
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children="Dashboard", style={"fontSize": 24, "fontWeight": "bold"}),

    dash_table.DataTable(
        id="data-table",
        data=df.to_dict("records"),
        page_size=20
    ),

    html.Div([
        html.Label("Select Feature:"),
        dcc.Dropdown(
            id="feature-dropdown",
            options=[{"label": col, "value": col} for col in df.columns],
            value=df.columns[0]
        )
    ]),

    dcc.Graph(id="histogram")
])

# Callback for updating the histogram
@app.callback(
    Output(component_id="histogram", component_property="figure"),
    Input(component_id="feature-dropdown", component_property="value")
)
def update_histogram(selected_feature):
    fig = px.histogram(df, x=selected_feature)
    fig.update_layout(
        title=f"Histogram of {selected_feature}",
        xaxis_title=selected_feature,
        yaxis_title="Frequency"
    )
    return fig

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Dash app for visualizing data from a CSV file. It includes a dropdown menu for selecting features and a histogram that updates based on the selected feature. ðŸ“Šâœ¨
